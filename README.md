## <h1 align="center"> ⚙️ Description | Development </h1>

In this project, everything learned up to now is brought together. I've developed an e-commerce platform where users will register, log in, view products, and create orders using the e-commerce API I built in the 1st Backend Project.

### Challenge 🎢 & Skills Achieved

After analyzing the project requirements, I have created the following points:

- User registration.
- User login with validations.
- Show products and add to the cart.
- Create orders from cart.
- User profile view.

Implemented:
- React Router
- Context
- Reducer
- Sass



Note that this project was completed within a very limited timeframe as part of an exercise for The Bridge Valencia's FullStack Bootcamp.
